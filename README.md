# CV_DoodleCam
AI-Powered Doodle Cam with OpenCV & Tkinter
Draw in the air using your webcam and a colored object — just like magic! 

 #Project Description
The AI Doodle Cam is a fun and interactive computer vision project that lets you draw virtually in mid-air using just a webcam and a blue-colored object (like a pen cap or sticker). The drawing appears live on screen, thanks to real-time object tracking using OpenCV. The GUI is designed using Tkinter, making the application user-friendly and visually engaging.
This project is perfect for beginners in computer vision and Python GUI development — combining creativity, interactivity, and technology into a single application.

 #Features
 Real-time object tracking (color-based using HSV)

 Air drawing canvas – draw without touching your screen

 Brush thickness control via slider

 Color palette with multiple brush colors

 Clear canvas button

 Save your artwork as an image file

 Beautiful Tkinter GUI with emojis and styled components

 #Tech Stack
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Tkinter
NumPy
PIL (Pillow)

# How It Works
1)Webcam Feed is captured using OpenCV.
2)A blue object is tracked in real-time using HSV color masking.
3)The path of the object is recorded and drawn on screen as the user moves.
4)The GUI handles interactions like changing brush color, clearing canvas, and saving doodles.
